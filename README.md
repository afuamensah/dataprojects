# Data Science and Information Structures

This is an accumulation of the final project from my Data Science class and the final Python exam from my Information Structures class. These were developed using Jupyter Notebook/Jupyter Lab. 

#### FinalReport.ipynb
This was a group project where we were given a task to take sample data, put it into SQLite, turn it into a .csv, then put it into Jupyter Notebook for data visualization using the imported Pandas library.

#### Final Exam.ipynb
This final exam was done individually and I was given 4 days to complete it. It takes all the concepts I learned over the course of the class. 

***These files can be viewed easily; however, in order for the correct changes to be made, Anaconda with Jupyter Lab and Jupyter Notebook must be installed.***
